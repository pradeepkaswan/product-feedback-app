## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete product feedback requests
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit feedback requests
- Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
- Filter suggestions by category
- Add comments and replies to a product feedback request
- Upvote product feedback requests
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

### Expected Behaviour

- Suggestions page
  - Only product feedback requests with a status of `suggestion` should be shown on the Suggestions page.
- Roadmap
  - Feedback requests with a status of `planned`, `in-progress`, or `live` should show up on the roadmap, and should be placed in the correct column based on their status.
  - Columns should be ordered by upvote totals.
- Creating a product request
  - When creating a new piece of feedback, an ID needs to be assigned which increments the current highest product request ID by 1.
  - The default status for a new piece of feedback is `suggestion`. This places it on the Suggestions page.
- Editing feedback
  - If a piece of feedback has its status updated to `planned`/`in-progress`/`live` it moves through to the roadmap and should show up in the correct column based on its new status.
- Add comments/replies
  - Use the data from the `currentUser` object in the `data.json` file to populate the user data for any new comments or replies.
  - Any comment/reply can have a maximum of 250 characters.
